This repository for my Framework learn from Spring, do it myself.


there are two modules SimpleSpring and SimpleSpringMVC. You can know from the name.
## SimpleSpring
In SimpleSpring I have implemented the **IOC container**, **dependency injection**, **bean fetching**, I use the **configuration class**, read the annotations in it, get the configuration information

I had implemented those annotations in this framework

**@Autowired**,
**@Component**,
**@ComponentScan**,
**@Scope**


### Problems:
  not implement circular dependency injection (had achieve in **SimpleSpringMVC**)
